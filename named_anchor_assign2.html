        <h2><u>The Heirs of the Dragon</u></h2></p>
        <p align="center">With both his sons dead, old King Jaehaerys I Targaryen convenes a Great Council to choose an heir. 
            The Westerosi lords select Jaehaerys' eldest grandson, Prince Viserys, over his eldest grandchild, Princess Rhaenys. 
            Nine years into his reign, King Viserys organizes a tournament to celebrate Queen Aemma Arryn's pregnancy, confident she is carrying his long-awaited male heir.
            The Small Council disregards Master of Ships Lord Corlys Velaryon's warning that the Triarchy, an alliance of Essos' Free Cities, threatens to cripple Westerosi shipping lanes.
            The Hand of the King, Ser Otto Hightower, criticizes Viserys's brother and heir, Prince Daemon, for his brutality as the City Watch commander.
            At the tournament, Ser Criston Cole, a young, handsome though common-born knight, outcompetes Daemon, while Aemma dies in childbirth.
            Her newborn son, Baelon, dies shortly after. Viserys refuses the council's pleas to appoint a new heir until Otto reveals that Daemon mockingly styled Baelon as, "The Heir for a Day." Outraged, Viserys banishes Daemon from King's Landing and appoints his only living child, Princess Rhaenyra, heir to the Iron Throne, revealing to her Aegon the Conqueror's dream that inspired him to unify Westeros.

            <h2><u>The Rogue Prince</u></h2>
            <p align="center">Six months after Rhaenyra is named the heir, Daemon has illegally occupied Dragonstone, supported by loyal City Watch guards. 
                When Prince-Admiral Craghas Drahar, known as the Crabfeeder, menaces the Stepstones archipelago at the Essos Triarchy's behest, Rhaenyra suggests showing force.
                The Small Council dismisses Rhaenyra's suggestion and instead relegates her to appointing a new Kingsguard knight.
                Ignoring others' advice, she chooses Ser Criston, the only knight with actual battle experience. 
                Ser Otto sends his teen-aged daughter,Lady Alicent, to privately console the grieving king.Ser Otto sends his teen-aged daughter, Lady Alicent, to privately console the grieving king; she advises that Viserys and Rhaenyra should discuss his kingly duty to remarry.
                Lord Corlys and his wife, Princess Rhaenys, propose that Viserys unite their Valyrian houses by marrying their twelve-year-old daughter, Laena. Meanwhile, the Small Council learns that Daemon, proclaiming himself the true heir, stole a dragon egg and intends to marry his mistress, Mysaria, as a secondary spouse. Otto and a small detachment sail to Dragonstone to retrieve the egg. Rhaenyra follows on her dragon, Syrax, and forces Daemon to renounce his false claims and give her the egg. Viserys weds Alicent, angering Corlys, who approaches Daemon to propose an alliance1</p>

                <h2><u>Chapter.3</u></h2>
                <h2><u>Second of His Name</u></h2>
                <p align="center">For three years, Lord Corlys and Prince Daemon have battled Craghas Drahar and his pirates in the Stepstones without the Iron Throne's support.
                    Meanwhile, King Viserys plans a great hunt to celebrate his and pregnant Queen Alicent's son Aegon's second birthday.
                    Rhaenyra resents her father's excessive attention towards her half-brother, Aegon.
                    The ailing king insists that Rhaenyra, now seventeen, must marry to form a strong alliance and protect their lineage.
                    Many suitors are considered, including two-year old Prince Aegon.Lord Lyonel Strong recommends Ser Laenor Velaryon, Lord Corlys' son, as a potential match to mend the rift between the two houses.
                    Overcoming previous doubts, Viserys assures Rhaenyra she remains his heir and can choose her consort. Meanwhile, brothers Hobert and Otto Hightower secretly scheme to make Aegon the successor, furthering their family's power and prestige.
                    After Ser Vaemond Velaryon pleads for the king's help, Viserys agrees to send aid to the Stepstones.
                    Seeing his brother's support as ending his chance to prove himself, Daemon acts as bait to ambush the Triarchy warriors, killing the Crabfeeder and winning the ensuing battle before the crown's forces arrive.</p>

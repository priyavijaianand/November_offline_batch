        <h1><u>Great Green Macaw</u></h1>
        <p align="center">
            Also known as the Buffon’s macaw or the great military macaw, the great green macaw is the world’s third-biggest macaw species. They reach 33.5 to 35.5 inches with a wingspan of 44 to 50 inches.

They’re also the second heaviest macaw after the hyacinth macaw, weighing around 1.3 kg.

        <p align="center">Despite their size, their tails are much shorter than other macaws.

            Great green macaws are also commonly mistaken for military macaws because they share similar markings and colorings – and they’re both referred to as a “military” bird, which adds to the confusion.
            
            However, great green macaws are much larger than military parrots.</p>

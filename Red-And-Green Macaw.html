        <h1 align="center"><u>Red-And-Green Macaw</u></h1>
        <p align="center">Red-and-green macaws are only second in size to hyacinth macaws.

            On average, they reach 35 to 37 inches, with a wingspan of 41 to 49 inches, depending on their size. Surprisingly, they’re slightly lighter than great green macaws, weighing 1.1 to 1.7 kg.
            
            Like the hyacinth macaw, red-and-green macaws don’t make good pets unless you can dedicate sufficient time to looking after the equivalent of a young child.

        <p align="center">Similarly, their powerful beaks can destroy household items and hurt your hands and fingers. That said, red-and-green macaws are known as “gentle giants” due to their sweet and loving nature.

            Because of their size, red-and-green macaws are difficult for owners to restrain. They’re strong birds who require lots of room, which most standard cages don’t provide.</p>

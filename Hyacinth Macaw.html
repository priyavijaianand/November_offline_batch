        <p align="center">The hyacinth macaw is the largest in the macaw species, making it the world’s biggest macaw (and the biggest blue macaw.)

            The average hyacinth macaw measures 40 inches from the top of its head to the tip of the tail. It also has a wingspan of 48 inches and weighs 1.2 to 1.7 kg,making it one of the heaviest parrots and the biggest.</p>
            <p align="center">A large proportion of its height comes from its massive tail, which is long and pointed. The tail feathers alone reach between 19 to 24 inches.

                As the biggest type of macaw, hyacinth macaws are rarely seen in captivity, as most standard cages are too small to house them comfortably.
                
                Similarly, the average house doesn’t offer enough room for hyacinth macaws to exercise and stretch their wings. They also live for up to 60 years, making them a long-term commitment.</p>
                <p align="center">Due to deforestation, hyacinth macaws are a threatened species, with their numbers dwindling.</p>
